# About

Product Design Leader with 11+ years of experience designing product systems that stay coherent as complexity increases.

I work on system-level product design problems: unifying fragmented SaaS platforms, scaling design and delivery infrastructure, and integrating AI in ways that enhance human judgment.

My focus is on building durable foundations that allow teams and products to evolve without losing clarity.

## Professional Journey

Over the past decade, I've led design transformations at companies ranging from payment platforms to enterprise communication systems. My work has resulted in measurable impact: 16x productivity increases, platforms serving 300M+ messages monthly, and design systems adopted across entire organizations.

## Approach

I believe in starting with systems thinking, moving fast through iteration, and letting data inform (not dictate) decisions. My work combines strategic thinking with hands-on execution—from research and architecture to implementation and measurement.
