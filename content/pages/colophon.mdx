# Colophon

How this site was built.

## Tech Stack

**Framework:** [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org) with App Router, [React 19](https://react.dev), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). Content is written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) and parsed with [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter).

**Styling:** [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com) for utility-first styles. [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations. [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) for accessible primitives (Dialog, Tabs, Tooltip, ScrollArea). [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer) for better typography.

**Hosting:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com). SEO via [next-seo](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) and [next-sitemap](https://github.com/iamvishnuske/next-sitemap).

## Typography

System font stack: `ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif` for performance and readability across devices.

## Source

The site is built as a personal portfolio. Product work can be password-protected via server-side auth and HTTP-only cookies. Analytics use Amplitude and optional Google Analytics.
