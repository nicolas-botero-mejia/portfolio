## Why This Matters to Me

In my 10+ years as a product designer, I've seen more projects fail from over-engineering than from shipping imperfect solutions. This quote from Voltaire perfectly captures what I learned at Sainapsis: **iteration beats perfection**.

## How I Apply It

When we started the design system transformation at Sainapsis, we could have spent 6 months building the "perfect" system. Instead, we:

1. Shipped an MVP in 2 weeks
2. Iterated based on real usage
3. Achieved 16x productivity increase

The imperfect v1 delivered more value than a perfect system would have.

## The Balance

This doesn't mean shipping garbage. It means:
- Ship something that solves 80% of the problem
- Learn from real users
- Iterate quickly
- Avoid analysis paralysis

Perfect is a moving target. Progress is measurable.
