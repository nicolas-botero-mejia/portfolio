## Overview

As Lead Product Designer for Ocean, I designed and scaled a comprehensive CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) platform serving **300M+ messages per month** across Colombia and India. The platform enables businesses to manage multi-channel communications (SMS, WhatsApp, Email) through a unified interface.

**Key Metrics:**
- **300M+ messages** processed monthly
- **2 markets** (Colombia, India) with localized experiences
- **4 communication channels** unified in one platform
- **98% platform uptime** maintained
- **40% reduction** in user errors through improved UX

## Context

RouteMobile needed a next-generation CPaaS platform to compete in rapidly growing markets. The existing solution was fragmented, difficult to use, and couldn't scale to meet growing demand.

**Market Challenges:**
- Diverse user needs across different markets
- Complex multi-channel communication workflows
- High technical complexity for non-technical users
- Need for real-time monitoring and analytics

## My Role

**Responsibilities:**
- Lead Product Designer for entire platform
- UX strategy and research lead
- Design system maintenance
- Cross-functional collaboration with engineering and product

**Team:**
- 2 Product Designers (led)
- 12 Engineers (collaborated)
- 2 Product Managers (partner)
- Regional stakeholders in Colombia and India

## The Challenge

Key challenges included:

1. **Complexity at Scale** - Managing millions of messages across multiple channels
2. **Diverse User Needs** - From technical developers to non-technical marketers
3. **Real-time Requirements** - Need for instant feedback and monitoring
4. **Market Localization** - Different needs in Colombia vs India
5. **Legacy System Migration** - Transitioning existing customers without disruption

## The Process

### Research & Discovery
- Conducted user interviews across both markets (40+ users)
- Analyzed support tickets and pain points
- Competitive analysis of CPaaS platforms
- Technical constraint mapping with engineering

### Design Strategy
- Developed user personas for different roles
- Created information architecture for complex data
- Designed scalable component system
- Established design principles for the platform

### Execution
- Built comprehensive design system
- Designed core workflows (campaign creation, monitoring, reporting)
- Created responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Developed real-time dashboard interfaces

### Testing & Iteration
- Usability testing with actual customers
- A/B testing for critical flows
- Performance optimization for data-heavy interfaces
- Continuous iteration based on feedback

## The Solution

**Ocean Platform: Unified CPaaS Experience**

### 1. Unified Dashboard
- Real-time monitoring of all communication channels
- At-a-glance metrics and KPIs
- Quick access to common actions
- Customizable views for different user roles

### 2. Campaign Management
- Streamlined campaign creation workflow
- Template library for common use cases
- Multi-channel campaign support
- Scheduled and triggered campaigns

### 3. Analytics & Reporting
- Comprehensive delivery and engagement metrics
- Custom report builder
- Exportable data for external analysis
- Real-time and historical views

### 4. Developer Tools
- API documentation integrated into platform
- Testing sandbox environment
- Webhook management
- Code examples in multiple languages

### 5. Administration
- User management and permissions
- Billing and usage tracking
- Security and compliance tools
- Multi-tenant support

## Impact & Results

### User Impact
- **40% reduction** in user-reported errors
- **60% faster** campaign creation time
- **95% user satisfaction** score
- **80% reduction** in support tickets

### Business Impact
- **300M+ messages** processed monthly
- **45% increase** in customer retention
- **30% growth** in platform adoption
- Successful launch in 2 major markets

### Technical Impact
- **98% platform uptime** maintained
- **2-second average** page load time
- Successfully scaled to handle peak loads
- Zero critical bugs in production

## Key Learnings

1. **Design for Scalability Early** - Architectural decisions made in early phases paid dividends as volume grew

2. **Real-time UX is Different** - Had to design specifically for constantly updating data

3. **Localization ≠ Translation** - Each market needed thoughtful adaptation beyond language

4. **Developer Experience Matters** - API documentation and tools were as important as UI design

5. **Performance is a Feature** - With millions of messages, every millisecond mattered

## Tools & Technologies

- Figma for design and prototyping
- AquaDS (custom design system)
- Principle for micro-interactions
- Mixpanel for analytics tracking
- Confluence for documentation
